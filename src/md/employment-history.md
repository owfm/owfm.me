## StoneX | Precious Metals Trading & Technology [2022<span>&#8211;</span>now]

{/_ > 2022-present, StoneX _/}

- Full-stack development
- Precious Metals & Derivatives trading
- Risk Management

In 2022 I was invited to join the PM trading desk, while retaining a developer remit. In this position I have focussed on improving trading- and sales team daily workflows, which had become essential as the business has grown. To that end I have built and maintain a suite of utility applets relating to pricing, valuation, PnL, and regulatory capital which quickly became indispensable on desk.

StoneX has a global precious metals presence and is one of the **largest non-bank players in the market**. In my trading role I am one of three London traders who manage **several billion USD of precious metals flow through our platform daily**, trading spot, forwards, options and futures across the main four precious metals. We also have a very active role in the sourcing, logistics and financing of our worldwide physical precious metals business.

I have completed CISI exams in Financial Regulation and Derivatives.

## Teacher of Physics, Head of KS5 Science, Specialist Leader in Education (SLE) for Physics

- Mentoring
- Leadership
- Communication
- Education

I have a deep passion for physics and have had a very rewarding five years sharing my love of the subject in the classrooms of this East London Comprehensive. I became a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-school-to-school-support-from-system-leaders#specialist-leaders-of-education-sles">Specialist Leader of Education (SLE)</a> for Physics in 2019, and in that role have **delivered many training and coaching sessions** supporting non-specialist physics teachers. **I was later awarded an “Expert Practitioner” award for outstanding mentoring of trainee teachers** by the University of Cantebury.

I’m proud that my A-level students’ progress was recognised as being in the **top 10% nationally** (via ALPS) in 3 of my first 4 years. I have appeared on Radio 4 with my students discussing a collaborative project I ran with Queen Mary University.

**I am passionate about sustainability and creating a more equal society**. In 2019 I proactively secured a £95k grant to improve the school’s energy efficiency with a lighting overhaul. I brought together a team of colleagues into a task-group aimed at reducing energy, paper and plastic usage and formed a student group to give the student body agency in driving sustainable initiatives. **I care deeply about female and BAME representation in STEM subjects**, co-ordinating my school’s involvement in a pilot study with King’s College and the Institute of Physics which resulted in a 5-fold increase in female uptake of A-Level physics.

## Technical Safety and Risk Engineer

### Xodus Group, Perth Australia [2011–2014] & RPS Risk Management, Warrington UK (2008–2011)

- SIL Assessment
- Fault/Event Tree Analysis
- HAZOP/HAZID
- Bowtie Analysis
- Safety Case Development
- Nuclear
- Oil & Gas
- Process Safety

As a consultant I worked with colleagues and embedded in client teams on **large, high-hazard and highly regulated process industry projects** in both nuclear and oil & gas facilities. We were tasked with analysing complex systems using a breadth of techniques and software to assess risks associated with fault conditions, and thus demonstrate acceptability of risk to regulators. These roles required extreme diligence and precise communication while working in highly secure environments.
