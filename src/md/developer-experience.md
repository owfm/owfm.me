## StoneX, London (2020–Present, Full Time)

StoneX is a Fortune 100 multinational providing commodity trading services. As part of the metals front-office development team, I focus on greenfield projects supporting base- and precious-metal trading operations.

### Selected Projects

**Forwards Pricer**: Developed a Next.js application for pricing precious metals forwards. Features include forward curve skew control, markup/spread curve adjustments, and interpolation for broken dates. I also designed and implemented an averaging and Asian swap pricer for accurately pricing more complex structures. This pricer is now used for deals with notional values of hundreds of millions of dollars every day and has become central to both sales and trading's pricing workflows.

**RegCap Playground**: Built a React tool allowing front office users to simulate the impact of trades on regulatory capital requirements. I worked closely with the treasury team and our regulatory accountants to validate this tool, and in the process identified a long-standing calculation error, fixing which led to a material improvement of our capital efficiency.

**Trade Execution Platform**: Led development of a trade execution platform for base metals. I re-wrote a Java backend service that had been created as a POC, created a fully responsive and accessible trade ticket widget, and implemented an additional "activity log" widget.
