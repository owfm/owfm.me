**I’m a passionate believer in the power of education, the importance of sustainability, and ensuring equal opportunities in our society**. I want to work in a company that embodies those ideals, not just in their rhetoric but in their choices about CSR, hiring, and the projects they’re engaged in.

I want to work in a company with a **strong team ethos**, with knowledge-sharing and **high code-quality** (through pair programming, code-review, TDD, CI/CD) central to the culture.

During my diverse experience working in different teams and across industries, I have had the opportunity to develop excellent skills in communication, teamwork, and leadership and I would add huge value to your multidisciplinary team. If you think you agree, [I'd love to hear from you](mailto:hi@ollimansell.co.uk).
